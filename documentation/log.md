# Project Build Logs

---

## LOG 1 — Step 1.1: Install Node.js

Description:  
Verified that Node.js and npm are correctly installed on the Windows development machine. No installation required.

Updated Specs:
- Node.js version: v22.20.0  
- npm version: 11.6.2  

Status: ✅ Completed  

---

## LOG 2 — Step 1.2: Project Initialization (Vite “vanilla”)

Description:  
Initialized a minimal Vite project in `C:\dev\aiStudio\widget_prototype` using the vanilla JavaScript template. Confirmed that `package.json` and the default file structure were generated and dependencies installed.

Updated Specs:
- Project name: `widget_prototype`  
- Vite version: 7.1.11  
- Directory contents: `src/`, `public/`, `index.html`, `package.json`, *(no `vite.config.js` by default — created manually later)*  
- Local dev server: Confirmed running at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)

Status: ✅ Completed  

---

## LOG 3 — Step 1.3: Vite Build Configuration (Library Mode)

Description:  
Created a new `vite.config.js` to configure Vite for library mode, ensuring the build produces a single, self-contained JavaScript file (`blue-widget.js`).

Updated Specs:
- Build output: `/dist/blue-widget.js`  
- Build format: IIFE (self-invoking browser-ready script)  
- Dynamic imports: Inlined for single-bundle guarantee  

Status: ✅ Completed  

---

## LOG 4 — Step 1.4: Component Creation (`src/main.js`)

Description:  
Implemented the `BlueWidget` web component as a self-contained class using the Shadow DOM for complete style encapsulation. Confirmed registration via `customElements.define('blue-widget', BlueWidget)`.

Updated Specs:
- Component name: `<blue-widget>`  
- Shadow DOM: `mode: 'open'` with inline style and text node  
- Style isolation: Verified via internal `<style>` tag inside shadow root  

Status: ✅ Completed  

---

## LOG 5 — Step 1.5: Local Build (Generate `/dist/blue-widget.js`)

Description:  
Executed Vite’s production build to produce a single bundled JavaScript file for the widget. Confirmed creation of `/dist/blue-widget.js`, the deployable artifact intended for cross-domain embedding.

Updated Specs:
- Build output: `dist/blue-widget.js` *(0.51 kB gzipped)*  
- Build tool: Vite v7.1.11  
- Bundle type: Single IIFE file, browser-ready  

Status: ✅ Completed  

LOG 6
Step 2.1 – Create Firebase Project
Description: Created a new Firebase project via the Firebase Console and confirmed project metadata. This establishes the cloud hosting environment for future CI/CD deployment.
Updated Specs:

Firebase CLI version: 14.20.0

Firebase Project name: fdaChatAIStudio

Firebase Project ID: gen-lang-client-0545699517

Firebase Project number: 253278659379

Web API Key: Not generated (yet)

Environment type: Unspecified

Apps registered: None (initial state)
Concept Notes:

Firebase = Google’s cloud platform for static hosting and web apps

Project ID = unique namespace for resources and deployments

Hosting = serves static assets globally via CDN

CORS = controls cross-domain resource access
Status: ✅ Completed

LOG 7
Step 2.2 – Create GitHub Repository
Description: Confirmed the creation of a new GitHub repository to serve as the remote version control origin for the widget project. This will later integrate with Firebase for automated CI/CD deployment.
Updated Specs:

GitHub Repository Name: widget_prototype

Repository Owner: raphaelfeliz

Repository URL: https://github.com/raphaelfeliz/widget_prototype.git

Visibility: (to confirm — likely Public)

Initialization: No README or .gitignore (local project will be pushed)
Concept Notes:

GitHub = remote code hosting

Repo = project version history

Origin = remote connection name

Push = upload commits to GitHub

CI/CD = automated deployment pipeline
Status: ✅ Completed

LOG 8
Step 2.3 – Initialize Local Git Repository
Description: Initialized Git in the local project directory and linked it to the remote GitHub repository. Verified the .git directory and remote origin configuration for both fetch and push operations.
Updated Specs:

Local Git initialized: True

Default branch: main

Remote name: origin

Remote URL: https://github.com/raphaelfeliz/widget_prototype.git

Repository state: Ready for first commit
Concept Notes:
Git = local version tracking
Branch main = main development line
Remote = online link to GitHub
Origin = default remote reference
Push = upload commits to GitHub
Status: ✅ Completed

LOG 9
Step 2.4 – Create .gitignore File
Description: Verified existence of .gitignore and confirmed it excludes non-essential directories such as node_modules and dist, along with logs and IDE files. This ensures a clean and efficient repository.
Updated Specs:

.gitignore present: True

Key exclusions: node_modules/, dist/, logs/, IDE metadata

Repository hygiene: Valid and complete
Concept Notes:
.gitignore = tells Git what not to track
node_modules = rebuildable dependencies
dist = generated build output
logs = transient data
clean repo = smaller, faster commits
Status: ✅ Completed

## LOG 10 — Step 2.5: First Code Commit & Push to GitHub

Description:  
Staged all project files, performed the initial commit, and successfully pushed them to the remote GitHub repository. Verified synchronization between the local `main` branch and `origin/main` with a clean working tree.

Updated Specs:  
- Branch: `main`  
- Remote: `origin` (GitHub)  
- Commit message: "Initial commit: project setup and Vite build"  
- Push status: Successful  
- Repository state: Clean and in sync  

Status: ✅ Completed  

## LOG 11 — Step 3.1: Install Firebase CLI (locally)

Description:  
Verified that the Firebase CLI is installed and authenticated on the local development machine. This enables project initialization, hosting setup, and deployment commands directly from the terminal.

Updated Specs:  
- Firebase CLI version: 14.20.0  
- Authenticated user: raphael.feliz@gmail.com  
- Login state: Active  
- Command scope: Hosting and CI/CD setup  

Status: ✅ Completed  

## LOG 12 — Step 3.2: Firebase Hosting Initialization

Description:  
Initialized Firebase Hosting for the `widget_prototype` project and linked it to the remote Firebase project `fdaChatAIStudio`. Generated configuration files `.firebaserc` and `firebase.json` defining hosting behavior and deployment targets.

Updated Specs:  
- Firebase Project: fdaChatAIStudio  
- Project ID: gen-lang-client-0545699517  
- Public directory: dist  
- SPA rewrite: No  
- GitHub CI/CD setup: Deferred (manual setup planned for Step 3.5)  
- Generated files:  
  - `.firebaserc` — project link reference  
  - `firebase.json` — hosting configuration rules  

Status: ✅ Completed  

## LOG 13 — Step 3.3: Configure CORS Headers

Description:  
Added a headers rule to `firebase.json` so all hosted files are served with permissive CORS (GET/OPTIONS), enabling third-party sites to load `blue-widget.js` without browser blocks. Validated configuration with a Hosting dry run.

Updated Specs:  
- Headers applied to: all files (`**`)  
- Access-Control-Allow-Origin: `*`  
- Access-Control-Allow-Methods: `GET, OPTIONS`  
- Access-Control-Allow-Headers: `Content-Type`  
- Validation: `firebase deploy --only hosting --dry-run` succeeded  
- Hosting domain (default): `https://gen-lang-client-0545699517.web.app`  

Status: ✅ Completed
